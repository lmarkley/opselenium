# OpSelenium
> a proof-of-concept project in web automation written in _Python 3.7_.

### What is it?

1. An experiment. 
2. A thing I needed that didn't exist
3. A *non-invasive* [^noninvasive], non-nausea-inducing, and **way-faster** way of doing something. 

### Why is it?

As I state in point #2 above: I wanted it, nobody had it, so I made it for myself. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Selenium 3.141.0
- Latest Chrome WebDriver

[^noninvasive]: I began with the assumption that if you alter any part of the "stack", you make all of the people mad. I've decided I'd rather not do that.
