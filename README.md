# OpSelenium - Multiprocessing edition
## Now with more threads!

### What is it?

1. an experiment
2. a thing I needed that didn't exist
3. a non-invasive, non-nausea-inducing, and way-faster way to do something

### Why the new branch?

I abide by a strict *the perfect is the enemy of the good* principle. The main branch works well (so far) but I want to make it faster and more efficient. Who doesn't wanna go fast?

### Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Selenium 3.141.0
- Latest Chrome WebDriver
